# Our plans
- Handle external `Provider`. You can't use [@miu](https://mui.com/) or other design-system with custom providers now ðŸ˜”
- Mobile version is't cool. `PropsTable` does't support adaptive 100%
- More customization for config. Favicon, text for i18next
- Some components for playground (CollapsedMenu, ...etc)
